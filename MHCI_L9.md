# Mobile HCI
### Lecture 9 - Evaluation & usability for Mobile
---
Evaluation of mbile devices is more cmplex than standard PCs because of the context of use:
- **Effects of environment** on user performance: environmental noise, walking, gaze, dual-tasking
- **Effects of the small physical form factor** are importantdue to issues from perception to motor control

### Methods of Evaluation
- Interviews
- Focus Groups
- Online surveys/questionnaires
- Usability tests

### 5 Measures of User Behaviour

- **Acquisition**: 
    - Where/what channels do users come from
- **Activation**:
    - What % have a 'happy' initial experience?
- **Retention**:
    - Do they come back and revisit over time?
- **Referal**:
    - Do they like it enough to tell their friends?
- **Revenue**:
    - Can you monetize any of this behaviour?

Acronym: **AARRR** (Priates enit)

### Testing Considerations

##### Controling Variables

Need to control things enough to collect valid data. Must try to ensure that unusual occurences do not just occur in one run of the experiement, in order to spread out data.

##### Choice of test environment

Choose environment based on interface. Testing outside may be necessary for certain apps. Sitting or walking? May need permission for testing if it is private property.

##### Participants

May need more participants than a lab study to deal with variations introduced by an outside environment. May need payment.

### Usability Metrics

Independant/Dependant variables:
- *Manipulate* the **independant variables**
- and then look for effects in the **dependant variables**.

**Time**:
- Task completion time
- Time in mode
- Time until event

**Input Rate**
**Mental effort**
**Usage Paterns**:
- Use frequency
- Information accessed
- Deviation from optimal solution

**Learning**:
- Shorter task time over sessions
