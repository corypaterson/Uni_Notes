### Context Awareness

> Context: any information that can be used to characterise the situation of entities, typically the location, identity and state of people, groups and computational and physical objects

Used in two ways in mobile systems:
1. Some systems encode context along with information so that it can later be used as a retrieval cue.
2. A more common approach is to use context dynamically to tailor the behaviour of the system or its response to patterns of use. The system can present information or services to the user, or automatically execute a service.


Context aware applications look at the *whos, wheres, whens* and *whats* of entities. The designer uses this information to determine the **user's intent** and **builds** the application such that is can satisfy this intent.

They need to use inference techniques to derive useful information from raw sensor data and bahvioural models
