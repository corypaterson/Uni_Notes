### Why Privacy?

1. Data collection and processing are core components of mobile technology
2. Simply offering strong security does not solve privacy issues
3. To build privacy aware systems we need to understand the legal nature of privacy and its social/legal realities.

### Border Crossings

There are four border crossings that are perceived as privacy violations:

**Natural Borders**:
- Physical limitations of observations, such as walls, clothing, darkness etc
- also includes phone calls and sealed letters

**Social Borders**:
- Expectations about confidentiality for members of certain social roles, such as family members, doctors and lawyers.
- Also includes that you do not expect your collegues to read personal messages or material you left lying around.

**Spatial or Temporal Borders**:

- The usual expectations of people that parts of their life, both in time and social space, can remain separated from eachother

**Borders due to Ephemeral Effects**:
- Described as a "fleeting moment", an unreflected utterance or action that one hopes gets forgotten soon.
- Old pictures/letters that one puts in the trash.

### Location Privacy 

**Location privacy** is the ability of an individual to move in a public space with the expectation that **under normal circumstances**, their location will not be systematically and secretly recorded for later use.
