### Lecture 6 - UI Guidelines and Patterns
---

>Guidelines tend to be based around **Interaction**, rather than an app's *visual feel*.

### UI Patterns

**Interaction design patterns** are a way to capture good solutions to common usability or accessibility problems in a specific context.

Thought pattern descriptions vary, many pattern libraries include some common elements:

- **Pattern name**: Choosing clear and descriptibe name will help people find the pattern.
- **Pattern description**: use a few additional lines of explanation to help explain how the pattern works.
- **Problem Statement**: Written in user-centered language - communicates what the user wants to achieve.
- **Use when**: Helps people understand situations when the design pattern applies
- **Solution**: Explains how to solve the problem, may include screenshots or even short videos demonstrating the pattern in action
- **Rationale**: Reasons 'why' the pattern works will reinforce the solution
- **Examples**: Shows how the pattern has been successfully applied. Screenshots and short descriptions
- **Comments**: A place for team members to discuss the use of the pattern, helps maintain an active resource and keeps the team engaged.

### Navigation Options

**Flat pages**: 
- Relatively simple apps that have a single main screen. (Weather app) can scroll through multiple versions of the same main screen, for different variations on the data.

**Tab bar**: 
- The tab bar is a set of buttons at the screen bottom that lets you switch between the apps main functions. Tap a button to go to the new screen.

**Tree Structure**: 
- Drill down through a hierarchy of categorized options or content (like folders on a desktop computer), then easily pull back up to the surface.

### Flat Pages

Pros:
 - Ideal for quick, focused content, suited for casual browsing of screens
 - Adapts to variable number of screens with customized content
 - Easy to use, navigations relies on familiar swipe gesture
 - Limited interface chrome; control requires minimal space, so content has more room.
 
Cons:
- Must swipe through stack one page at a time
- Doesnt scale well to a large number of screens
- Doesnt handle scrolling well
- Users may overlook the small page indicator and miss additional screens


### Accordion
- Lets the user see more information while on same screen
- Can be more efficient than navigating to new screen, then back-up
- Show whtehr in expanded or collapsed state with icon

### Tree Structure

Pros:
- Scales well for large number of categories and items
- Familiar outline, organization is easily understood
- Direct interaction with content is intuitive and limits interface chrome
- List based display adapts well for user-customized categories

Cons:
- Primary features are listed only on top-level, unlike tab bar's always-on-display
- Inefficient switching among main features or categories (have to come up before drilling down again)
