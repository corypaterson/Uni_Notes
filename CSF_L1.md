# Cyber Security Fundamentals
### Lecture - Intro
---

### CIA

- **Confidentiality**: assests are only accessible by authorised parties
- **Integreity**: assets can only be modified by authorised parties
- **Availability**: assets are accessible to authorised parties

**Confidentiality**:

- Implies an access control mechanism
    -  To restrict access to unauthorised parties
-  Different Permissions
    - Control which assets are able to be accessed
    - Control which type of access to the assets
        - read, write, execute etc.

**Integrity**:

- Ensure nothing is lost or deleted
- Make sure nothing is changed
- Need to **prevent** the integreity being compromised
- If comprimised, need to **detect** how integrity was lost

**Availablity**:

- Have capacity to meet demands
- Resources are allocated fairly
- Fault tolerance and recovery from failure


### Security in Context

Cyber assets:
- Anything with a value that is related to computer technology.
- Have **vulnerabilities** which can be exploited, causing **threats** to the assets.

**Owners** are the people responsible for the cyber assets. They want to minimise the **risks** to that threaten the cyber assets and employ **coutnermeasures** to do this.

### Risks

Risks arrise when an assets has a vulnerability which can be exploited. 

Threats can be: **Accidental**, **Deliberate** or **Environmental**.

**Deliberate Threats** can be classified as:
 - Interception, which breaks confidentiality
 - Interruption, which breaks availability
 - Modification, which breaks integity
 - Fabrication, which also breaks integrity
 
### Types of threat

- Physical damage: fire, water, dust, heat
- Natural events: weather, volcanic activity etc.
- Loss of power
- Disturbance due to electromagnetic radiation
- Compromise of information: eavesdropping, remote spying.
- Technical failure of equipment or software
- Unauthorised actions: Illegal processing of data, using pirated software
- Compromise of function: abuse of access, denial of service

### Where Vulnerabilities can Occur

- Hardware: environmental damage, wear n tear
- Software: bugs, insufficient testing
- Network: unprotected coms, single point of failure
- Personnel: lack of personnel or insufficient training.
- Site: poor geographical location, unstable power grid.
- **Lack of appropriate policies**, **failure to ensure compliance with these**

### Dealing with threats

Different ways to deal with threats to systems:

- Reduce or remove threats via:
    - Preventative, Detective, Reactive and Corrective techniques
- Accept the threats (if impact not too great)
- Avoid threats (do processes in a different manner)
- Transfer the responsibility to someone else (pay a consulting agent)

The way to deal with threats has **tradeoffs**. Security has **costs**, therefore loss and gain must be weighed up. It also takes **time** when assessing risks and developing policies & compliance measures.

### Security Engineering

> The process for ensuring security of developed systems.

First, **identify** the **security requirements**. This is a statement of the system's behaviour with risks, threats and countermeasures.

Then, **create policies** to satisfy these requirements.

Finally, create and use **mechanisms** to **ensure compliance** with these policies

### Non-technical Factors

PEOPLE!

**Users** may not comply with security policies, **Organisations** may not develop appropriate policies and **Delevelopers** may not adhere to secure guidelines when building systems.

### Dealing with People

**Enforcement**: Punish people who do not adhere to the policies put in place.

**Education**: make sure people understand how to adhere to policies and the reason they are in place.

**Monitoring users**: seeing what actually happens. Workers that are being watched are proven to be less effective, so monitoring needs to be unobtrusive. 

**Monitoring Policy Development**: Must ensure legal compliance, and must have good internal organisational mechanisms.

**Monitoring Developers**: Make sur ethey are using the appropriate software development process.
