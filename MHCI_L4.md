### Basic Activities of Interaction Design

1. Identify **needs** and **establishing requirements**:
    - Target users
    - Needs and wants of target users

2. Develop alternative designs:
    - Suggesting ideas for meeting the requirements
    - Conceptual design and physical design

3. Build interactive versions of the designs:
    - Paper-based prototypes
    - Role-playing users
    - Adobe prototypes

4. **Evaluate** designs
    - Determining usability and acceptability of the product
    - User involvement throughout the process

### How to build a 5* mobile application

1. **Understand**:
    - What can your target device do? (mobile and wearable)
2. **Imagine**:
    -  How to enhance your features with the device's capabilities
    -  How can you use its unique features to take input or give feedback to users?
3. **Context**:
    - What is your user doing?
    - Where is your user?
    - Woo/What is near the user?
    - Who is the user?
4. **Make use of online data**
    - Grab useful information from online APIs especially after relying on contextual data

### Skeuomorph

**Skeuomorphism** is the design concept of making virtual items resemble their real-world counterparts.

Calculators, bookshelves, notepads etc...

### App Definition Statement
An application definition statement is a concise, concrete declaration of an app's main purpose and its **intended audience**. 

**List all the features you think user's might like**

- You try to capture all the tasks related to your main product idea. If this list is long, it can be narrowed down later

**Determine who your users are**:

- In the context of the app you're planning, what is most important to your users?

**Filter the feature list through audience definition**: 
- If after this, you end up with a few features - you're in the right place. Great mobile applications focus on the task user's want to accomplish. Now you can craft your application defniition statement, concretely summarizing what the app does and for whom.

### Mobile Apps Cater For -

##### Microtasking:

Getting things done in **short bursts**. Quick access to ideas, contacts and information. Accommodate users in a hurry, optimise for brief recurring tasks.

##### Local Issues:

About things close by. What shops/restaurants/bars are close by? Who is nearby? Use of sensors to reduce need to enter text and to narrow options.

##### Boredum:

Many apps have a games or entertainment focus. Can be ways for people to lose themselves, explore new things or pleasantly pass the time.

### Paper Prototyping

Prototypes give people something concrete they can interact with. You can focus on behaviour, instead of opinions. They dont need to be perfect, just functional.

Make changes to prototypes during the usability process. It encourages people to be creative and more people can contribute to the design.

Both sites suplement with protoyping.

##### Use a spectrum of prototypes:

- Paper prototypes
- Static wireframes linked together
- Interactive Prototypes
- Fully coded prototypes

### Prototype & Iterate

Before investing significat resources into implementation, you **must** create prototypes for user testing (even if only testing a few peers). 

Paper prototypes can work initally, but creating a **mock app** with **placeholder content**, will help dramatically for gaining user feedback. 

Keep refining this process until you see good reviews from human tests and users are happy with a design (you wont please everyone though!).
